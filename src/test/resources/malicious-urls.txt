# Malicious URL Patterns for Security Testing
# KotlinFFetch Document Following Security Tests
#
# This file contains various URL patterns that should be blocked
# by the hostname security restrictions in document following.

# File Protocol URLs (should be blocked)
file:///etc/passwd
file:///c:/windows/system32/config/sam
file:///proc/self/environ
file:///dev/random
file://localhost/etc/hosts
file:///var/log/auth.log

# Data URLs (should be blocked due to no hostname)
data:text/html,<script>alert('XSS')</script>
data:text/html,<h1>Malicious Content</h1>
data:image/svg+xml,<svg><script>alert('XSS')</script></svg>
data:application/javascript,alert('malicious code')
data:text/plain,sensitive data here

# JavaScript URLs (should be blocked)
javascript:alert('XSS')
javascript:void(0)
javascript:window.location='http://malicious.com'
javascript:document.write('<script>alert("XSS")</script>')
javascript:eval('malicious code')

# Comments for additional context:
# 
# Security Considerations:
# 1. All file:// URLs should be blocked completely
# 2. data: URLs should be blocked as they have no hostname
# 3. javascript: URLs should be blocked completely
# 4. Non-HTTP(S) protocols should generally be blocked
# 5. IP addresses may need special handling
# 6. Suspicious paths and query parameters should be logged
# 7. IDN homograph attacks require careful validation
# 8. Extremely long URLs should be truncated or rejected
# 9. Control characters in URLs should be rejected
# 10. Internal network URLs should be blocked in production

# Test Categories:
# - Protocol-based attacks: file://, javascript:, data:
# - Network-based attacks: internal IPs, suspicious hosts
# - Path traversal attacks: ../ sequences
# - Injection attacks: XSS, SQL injection attempts
# - Social engineering: IDN homographs, shortened URLs
# - Buffer overflow attempts: extremely long URLs
# - Encoding attacks: URL-encoded malicious content
